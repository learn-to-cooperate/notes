# A Minimalistic Template

**Date:** 2026-12-12

I have created a `_template.md` file to serve as a structural blueprint for all future notes. This ensures consistency across the collection while remaining lightweight.


## Implementation

To create a new note:

1. **Copy**: Open `_template.md` and copy the contents (`Ctrl+A`, `Ctrl+C`).
2. **Create**: Create a new file following the existing naming convention (e.g., `0006.md`).
3. **Initialize**: Paste the template content and update the **Title** and **Date**.

## Workflow Benefits

* **Consistency**: Standardizes the metadata header for every note.
* **Agility**: Removes the friction of manual formatting.
* **Environment-Agnostic**: Works in any Markdown editor or directly within the GitHub UI.
