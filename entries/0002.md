# 0002.md – Why People Cooperate

**Date:** 2025-12-31

Cooperation is one of the central behaviors that allow humans to achieve more together than alone. People cooperate for a variety of reasons, both intrinsic and extrinsic.

## 1. General motivations for cooperation

1. **Shared goals and mutual benefit**

   * People are more likely to cooperate when the outcome benefits everyone involved.
   * Example: two neighbors building a shared fence, or a team completing a project.

2. **Reciprocity**

   * Individuals often cooperate with the expectation that others will return the favor in the future.

3. **Social recognition**

   * Cooperation can improve one’s reputation, status, or acceptance in a group.

4. **Intrinsic satisfaction**

   * Some people enjoy helping or contributing because it feels good, aligns with personal values, or creates a sense of purpose.

5. **Norms and rules**

   * Cultural, organizational, or legal rules can encourage cooperation and discourage selfish behavior.


## 2. Cooperation in GitHub projects

Open-source or shared repositories illustrate many of the above motivations:

1. **Common goals**

   * Contributors work together to improve software, documentation, or tools for a shared benefit.

2. **Reputation and recognition**

   * Commits, pull requests, and contributions are visible; active contributors gain respect and credibility.

3. **Learning and skill development**

   * People contribute to gain experience, improve their coding skills, or experiment with new ideas.

4. **Community and social bonds**

   * Even in asynchronous, global projects, contributors often develop friendships, mentorships, or networks.

5. **Fun and intrinsic motivation**

   * Many contributors simply enjoy building, problem-solving, or being part of a creative endeavor.


### Notes / Observations

* Cooperation is often a mixture of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations.
* In GitHub projects, motivation may shift depending on the type of repository (personal, organizational, open-source).
* Understanding what drives contributors can help design better workflows, incentives, and rules.
