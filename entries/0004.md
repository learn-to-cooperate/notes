# Org Profile Setup

**Date:** 2026-01-09

Today I focused on setting up the organizational profile for *Learn to Cooperate*.

* Created `.github/profile/README.md` as the org homepage.
* Learned about the “special” `.github` repo for profile pages

## The .github repository

> **.github** is a ✨*special*✨ repository that you can use to add a README.md to your public organization profile, visible to anyone.
> Make sure it’s public and initialize it with a README in the profile directory to get started.

The **profile** folder is mandatory.
