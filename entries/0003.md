# Mythos Motivation
**Date: 2025-12-31**

A note from back in the early 2000s: My boss at the time mentioned a book called _Mythos Motivation_ by Reinhard K. Sprenger, a German author.

He said you can’t really motivate people from the outside — they’re either motivated or they’re not. That was the main idea of the book, as he described it.

It argues that external incentives, praise, or motivational techniques don’t create lasting motivation. Real drive comes from within.

I never read the book myself, but the point he made has stayed with me.
